# my-diary-demo

Hello Guys !!!!!

So I just started learning backend and I went on creating this Demo-Personal-Diary for myself

Using MongoDB , I stored all the posts in the backend,

I am hoping to add authentication in the near future as everyone has been asking me to do so.

I will definitely improve the CSS, as right now it only works for laptops :(

Keep suggesting me good things and your are open to pull requests and add the changes if you want to.

Thank You :)
